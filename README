Net-Amazon-S3-ACL version 0.1.0

This module represents an S3 Access Control List; it is a representation
of the XML ACL that is easier to handle. As such, there are methods
that ease passing from one representation to the other, namely
"parse" (to parse an XML document into an object) and "stringify" (to
get the XML representation of the ACL).
